# FreeCodeCamp Javascript DSA Certification
The following projects are completed as part of FreeCodeCamp certification. All projects passed automated test suites:

## Palindrome Checker
- This project is a Palindrome Checker that determines if a given string is a palindrome, which means it reads the same forwards and backward.
- It's a simple JavaScript application that evaluates strings to check for palindromes.

## Roman Numeral Converter
- The Roman Numeral Converter project is designed to convert Arabic numerals into Roman numerals and vice versa.
- It's implemented in JavaScript and can handle a wide range of numbers.

## Caesars Cipher
- The Caesars Cipher project is an implementation of the ROT13 algorithm, a simple letter substitution cipher.
- It encrypts and decrypts messages using a simple letter shift.

## Telephone Number Validator
- The Telephone Number Validator project is a tool for checking if a given string represents a valid U.S. phone number.
- It's a JavaScript application that uses regular expressions to validate phone numbers.

## Cash Register
- The Cash Register project is a JavaScript application that simulates a cash register.
- It calculates the change to be given based on the purchase price, payment, and the available denominations in the cash register drawer. It ensures that the exact change is provided when possible and handles different currency denominations.

These projects demonstrate proficiency in JavaScript and ability to solve a variety of programming challenges. All projects are designed to meet specific criteria and pass automated test suites, showing commitment to quality and accuracy in work.
